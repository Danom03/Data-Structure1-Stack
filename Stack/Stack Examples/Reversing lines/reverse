I'll find somebody
To find somebody
All I need is
All I want is
Take my body
Take my body

Why did you leave me
But if you loved me

Alone without you by my side
I lay in tears in bed all night
I died a little bit inside
When you said your last goodbye

I could die as a happy man I'm sure
'Cause if I could see your face once more
To hear you knocking at my door
All I want is nothing more
